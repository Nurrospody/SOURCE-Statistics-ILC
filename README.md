# Statistics-ILC  

My reports and timecards all have two file versions: *.md* and *.Rmd*--for reading on github, you'll want the *.md* and all of my hyperlinks in this README will go to those.  For pulling files up onto R, you'll want the *.Rmd* files.

## "Chapter Reports" folder
Contains both .Rmd and .md files of my Chapter Reports for book *Learn R for Applied Statistics : With Data Visualizations, Regressions, and Statistics*.  Also contains "*_files" folders that are automatically created and contain plots for my reports.
My Chapter Reports show my work and the commands I've practiced with in R.

## "Timecards" folder
Contrains both .Rmd and .md files of my timecards.  
Each week has its own Timecard.  In these timecards, I record via stopwatch how long I work on my ILC each day of the week.  I also supply a brief summary of the days' activities.  The very first timecard also sets up my working plan for the quarter.

## "data_sources" folder
Contains *.csv*, *.png*, and other misc. files for my reports (of any kind) to pull from.  For the most part, If links to the files are relevant, they will be contained within their respective reports.  The following direct links are exceptions:
