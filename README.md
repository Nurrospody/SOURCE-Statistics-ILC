My reports and timecards all have two file versions: .md and .Rmd files.
For reading on github, you'll want the .md and all of the hyperlinks in this README will go to those. For pulling files up onto R, you'll want the .Rmd files.

## "Chapter Reports" folder
Contains both .Rmd and .md files of my Chapter Reports.  Also contains "*_files" folders that are automatically created and contain plots for my reports.
My Chapter Reports show my work and the commands I've practiced with in R.

## "Timecards" folder
Contrains both *.Rmd* and *.md* files of my timecards.  
Each week has its own Timecard.  In these timecards, I record via stopwatch how long I work on my ILC each day of the week.  I also supply a brief summary of the days' activities.  The very first timecard also sets up my working plan for the quarter.
