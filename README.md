# Statistics-ILC  

My reports and timecards all have two file versions: *.md* and *.Rmd*--for reading on github, you'll want the *.md* and all of my hyperlinks in this README will go to those.  For pulling files up onto R, you'll want the *.Rmd* files.

## "Chapter Reports" folder
Contains both .Rmd and .md files of my Chapter Reports.  Also contains "*_files" folders that are automatically created and contain plots for my reports.
My Chapter Reports show my work and the commands I've practiced with in R.

## "Timecards" folder
Contrains both .Rmd and .md files of my timecards.  
Each week has its own Timecard.  In these timecards, I record via stopwatch how long I work on my ILC each day of the week.  I also supply a brief summary of the days' activities.  The very first timecard also sets up my working plan for the quarter.

## "data_sources" folder
Contains *.csv*, *.png*, and other misc. files for my reports (of any kind) to pull from.
