These first two 'chapters' are very short compared to the other chapters in this book, so they have been combined into one report.  The introduction has no hands-on programing aspect and merely sets up some context for statistics as a field, so the only thing recorded for it here are the notable vocabulary.  

### Notable Vocabulary from Introduction  
**R** - A programing language for statistical computing and analysis.  

**HLL** - High-level languages (like R) are programing languages made to 'make sense' to humans, but take more time for a computer to process.  

**LLL** - Low-level languages are computer-language based programing languages.  They are less intuitive to use, but faster to excecute.  

**Statistics** - A collection of mathematics that deals with the organization of, analysis of, and interpretation of data.  Types of statistics include: descriptive, inferential, regressions analysis.

**Data science** - Statistics + computer science + machine learning + buisness expertise  

**Data mining** - Identifying patterns from numeric information  

**Data text mining** - Identifying patterns from text-based information, often in the form of human languages.  This requires techniques like: text classification, text clustering, part-of-speech tagging, sentiment analysis.  

**NLP** - "Natural Language Processing"; this type of machine learning helps with recognizing human language text-based patterns.  Important for Data text mining.

**Big Data** - Data that's too big and complex for a computer to process on its own. Factors that make data Big are the volume of data, the speed of data coming in (velocity), and the variety of techniques required to analyze the data properly.  

**Descriptive analytics** :: descriptive statistics 

**Predictive analytics** :: inferential statistics  

**Perscriptive analytics** :: using and applying inferential statistics 


### Notable Vocabulary from Chapter 2
**IDE** - Integrated Development Environment  
**GUI** - Graphical User Interface  
**CSV** - Comma-seperated Values

### Very Handy Figure from Chapter 2 
![](../data_sources/CH2_1.png)
This figure shows the placement of the R Code Editor (toedp left corner), Workspace Showing Variables (top right), R Console (bottom left), Plots and Others (bottom right).  It is on page 22 of *Title:Learn R for Applied Statistics* in the RStudio: The IRE for R section.  I frequently referred to this figure.

### Commands Used in Chapter 2: print(), data, summary(), plot()
The **print() function** is the first function introduced in Chapter 2.  I printed the text "Hello World", and also experimented with being able to print *any* text by talking about my squeaky doorhinge.  Use of this function has not yet been explained in R, but if I remember correctly, when using Kali Linux the print() function (or whatever its equivilant is) is important so that you can select what was printed and further use it in command line.  
ETA: I later discovered that print() is very handy for verifying work, and making sure a variable was programed correctly.  
```{r print}
print("Hello World"); print("The doorhinge for our room is really squeaky and loud");
```
 
The book wanted me to use a data set called MyData to see **output of all the data; summary of the data; and a plot of the data** . . . I do not have a .csv file named myData.  However I DO have cars data that comes automatically from creating an Rmarkdown type file, so I used *that* data to experiment with listing all the data; giving a summary of the data; and plotting the data.  
ETA: When I proofread this report later, it seemed that 'MyData' was probably what the book named a variable, not what the data set itself was called.  

To Run Code: If I typed into the R Code Editor, I needed to highlight the command and use Run; if I typed it into the R Console, I simply need to press Enter on my keyboard.  The plot() command makes a plot appear in the Plots and Others section, wheras naming the dataset and using the summary() command makes the information appear in the R Console.
```{r cars}
cars; summary(cars); plot(cars)
```

Chapter 2 also familiarized me with the **History tab** in Workspace; if I double click on something in the workspace, it will appear in the R Console, and then I can press Enter to run it.

I typed this report as an Rmd (R Markdown) file within the R Code Editor.
