#### Reading an Excel File **New Commands Used: read.xlsx(),**
Now that I had the "xlsx" package properly unpacked and required, I could start trying to read an .*xlsx* file.  Once I fixed my working directory to be data_sources (I changed my default working directory to data_sources, since changing it manually each time was annoying; I should figure out how projects work, though.), I could read the file.  
It looks similar to the *.csv* file when opened, key differences being the addition of an NA column that has the number of each row . . . and slightly wider spacing between values.
```{r read xlsx}
#XCTF <- read.xlsx(file="ctf_performance.xlsx", 1);
```

#### Writing an Excel File **New Commands Used write.xlsx()**
```{r write excel}
#write.xlsx(data.frame(XCTF), file ="ctf_performance.xlsx", sheetName = "Riley CTF", col.names = TRUE, row.names = FALSE);
```

With this command I wrote to the *.xlxs* file.  GitHub desktop then tells me the binary file has changed.  Previously the first sheet was only called Sheet1; now it is named.

#### Reading an SPSS File  
An SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) file actually uses the *.sav* file extension.  Reading it into R necessitates installing the "foreign" package, requiring the foreign package, and then assigning a variable using the read.spss command.
```{spss}
install.packages("Foreign"); 
require("foreign");
#SCTF <- read.spss(file="ctf_performance.sav", to data.frame = TRUE);
```
The excecution is exactly the same as a *.csv* or *.xlsx* file read.
