#### Reading an Excel File **New Commands Used: read.xlsx(),**
Now that I had the "xlsx" package properly unpacked and required, I could start trying to read an .*xlsx* file.  Once I fixed my working directory to be data_sources (I changed my default working directory to data_sources, since changing it manually each time was annoying; I should figure out how projects work, though.), I could read the file.  
It looks similar to the *.csv* file when opened, key differences being the addition of an NA column that has the number of each row . . . and slightly wider spacing between values.
```{read xlsx}
XCTF <- read.xlsx(file="ctf_performance.xlsx", 1);
```

#### Writing an Excel File **New Commands Used write.xlsx()**
```{write excel}
write.xlsx(data.frame(XCTF), file ="ctf_performance.xlsx", sheetName = "Riley CTF", col.names = TRUE, row.names = FALSE);
```
![](../data_sources/xctf2.png)
With this command I wrote to the *.xlxs* file.  GitHub desktop then tells me the binary file has changed.  Previously the first sheet was only called Sheet1; now it is named.

#### Writing an SPSS File **New Commands: write.table(), write.foreign()**  
An SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) file actually uses the *.sav* file extension.  Reading it into R necessitates installing the "foreign" package, requiring the foreign package, and then assigning a variable using the read.spss command.  
I didn't have a *.sav* file lying around, so I wrote my own.
```{r wrsps}
require(foreign)
library(foreign)
fur <- c("red", "brown", "grey")
eyes <- c("blue", "blue", "brown")
age <- c("7 months", "1 year", "3 years")
foxes <- data.frame(age, eyes, fur)
write.table(foxes, "spfox.txt", sep = "\t")
write.foreign(foxes, "spfox.txt", "spfox.sav", package = "SPSS")
print(foxes);
```
Rather than writing a data.frame all in one line, I assigned all the variables *first* and then assigned it to a data.frame.  This felt much less clunky than the previous way I made a data.frame.  Then I wrote that table to a *.txt* file, and wrote that data to a *.sav* file.  
[LINK](https://github.com/Nurrospody/SOURCE-Statistics-ILC/blob/master/data_sources/spfox.sav) to the *.sav* file.  It looks very satisfying with all its new fancy headers!  

#### Reading an SPSS File + JSON **New Commands: read.spss()**  
Technically reading an SPSS file should work exactly the same as an xlsx or csv file, but I had some issues getting it to work, mostly because of errors.
```{spss}
require(foreign)
fox2 <- read.spss(file="../data_sources/spfox.sav", to data.frame = TRUE);
```
I tried read.spss using the .sav file format, .spss format, .sps format, even the .txt format, but I always got this type of error: Error in read.spss(file = "spfox.sav", to.data.frame = TRUE) : 
  file 'spfox.sav' is not in any supported SPSS format  
  I'm not sure what's up, especially since it knits perfectly fine in my Rmd file.  It also seems to change my .txt and .sav files to something they're not supposed to be:  
![](../data_sources/foxb.png)
It was originally what's in green, but trying to fox2 <- read.spss(file) changed both the .txt and the .sav to what's in the red.  I'm not sure why that's what it became.  Luckily I caught it fast enough to both fix it in-console, and catch a screenshot of the incorrect data.  
I'll revisit it later when it's more important.  
I also installed the "rjason" package as per the book section.  It uses the same read and require function as everything else.  
  
#### Basic Data Processing **New Concepts Learned: Selecting Data; Select Variable with $, Sort Data (accending and descending order), Filtering, Removing Missing Values, Remove Duplicates**  
For these excercises, I used the CTF dataset I received from my partner.  
```{r read}
CTF <- read.csv(file="../data_sources/ctf_performance.csv", header=TRUE, sep=',')
CTF;
```
Then I **selected data** to view only the fields I was most interested in.  
```{r select}
CTF[, c("Value", "Time")];
```
Then I **selected a variable** with $ to view it.  I discovered that I can select multiple variables in this way, but doing so looks slightly different than selecting data.
```{r $}
CTF$Challenge;
CTF$Challenge;CTF$Category
```
Next I **sorted the data**.  By default, the data is in asccending order.  Descending can be done if it is specified TRUE.  
```{r sort}
CTF[order(CTF$Value), ];
CTF[order(CTF$Value, decreasing = TRUE), ];
```
Data can be sorted by **multiple variables** as well, but I think it's pretty clear that R doesn't by default read these time values correctly.
```{r multisort}
CTF[order(CTF$Value, CTF$Time, decreasing = TRUE), ];
```
Data can be **filtered with boolean expressions**.  Here I filtered to find only flags that were worth more than 10 points, only withihn the first 19 flags earned.  I was impressed to see quite a lot!  It's also easy to see that within the first 19, there were only 2 scores above 50.  
```{r filter}
CTF[CTF$Value > 10 & CTF$X < 20, ];
```
I could **omit NA data**, but there is no data to omit.
```{omit}
na.omit(CTF);
```
Lastly, I can **remote duplicate values**.  This isn't terribly useful for this dataset, but we can easily see that there's 7 different point values.  
```{r dupe}
CTF[!duplicated(CTF$Value), ];
```
Once I did all of these excercises, I noticed that my report wasn't knitting properly--it wasn't printing anything.  In my RMarkdown tab on the RConsole, there were a bunch of messages about unknown language engines for knitting . . . I had gotten tired of writing r inside of every {} that I had to name my code blocks with, because nothing mentioned to me that it was neccesary.  But the error messages I got led me to believe it is neccesary:
```{note}
1: In get_engine(options$engine) :
  Unknown language engine 'wrsps' (must be registered via knit_engines$set()).
```
This revealed some interesting things to me:  
1. If I wanted to write in a different language than R, I could do so as long as I registered it.  
2. Having the wrong language means that knit will not catch any errors I've made, which is bad for checking my work.  
3. But because it will not catch any errors I make, if I want to write anything inside of a codeblock but not have it actually be code . . . I can simply fail to specify the language.  There's probably other, more professionally appropriate ways to do this.

I fixed this by adding r into the {} names of of code blocks, and now it is printing succesfully.  Code blocks that I mentioned "will come back to later" for, I left it untouched.
