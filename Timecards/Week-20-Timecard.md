**Learning Objectives this week** - resampling, non-parametric tests,
more data stuff with server

**Total Time inclusive from 1SEP2020 to end of goal** :

This is the last week\! The goal this week is to do some resampling and
get the linear regression plot made if I can. I hurt my hand so working
at the computer is kind of hard, so resampling is the biggest priority.

**Tuesday**
