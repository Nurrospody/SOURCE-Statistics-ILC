================

**Monday** - 3 hours 2 minutes - Typed up end of week reflection for
week 4, finished up loop report, made new timecard. Worked with the
calculator function at the end of chapter 3\`. While reading the chapter
review, I discovered that it didn’t *actually* teach me how to use loops
to print the same character-based message a hundred times . . . so I
figured out how to do it before closing out of chapter 3.

**Tuesday** - 3 hours 12 minutes - Begun reading chapter 4 (descriptive
statistics) and working on chapter 4 report\! Had to go onto an Rtools
instalation adventure to use the xlsl package.

**Wednesday** - Aprx. \~2 hours - fixed an issue wehre I couldn’t
require(xlsx) because the file path didn’t exist, or java wasn’t
installed, or the environment variable wasn’t made in windows . . .

**Thursday** - 1 hours 37 minutes - created second report, continued
work on chapter 4, figured out why images work the way they do in
markdown (it’s a hyperlink, but with no text–instead an \! image)

**Friday** - 0 hours 0 minutes - work description

**Saturday** - 0 hours 0 minutes - work description

**Sunday** - 0 hours 0 minutes - work description

End of week reflection.
