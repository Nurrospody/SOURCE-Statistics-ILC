================

**Monday** - 3 hours 2 minutes - Typed up end of week reflection for
week 4, finished up loop report, made new timecard. Worked with the
calculator function at the end of chapter 3\`. While reading the chapter
review, I discovered that it didn’t *actually* teach me how to use loops
to print the same character-based message a hundred times . . . so I
figured out how to do it before closing out of chapter 3.

**Tuesday** - 3 hours 12 minutes - Begun reading chapter 4 (descriptive
statistics) and working on chapter 4 report\! Had to go onto an Rtools
instalation adventure to use the xlsl package.

**Wednesday** - Aprx. \~2 hours - fixed an issue wehre I couldn’t
require(xlsx) because the file path didn’t exist, or java wasn’t
installed, or the environment variable wasn’t made in windows . . .

**Thursday** - 1 hours 37 minutes - created second report, continued
work on chapter 4, figured out why images work the way they do in
markdown (it’s a hyperlink, but with no text–instead an \! image)

**Friday** - 15 minutes - typed up summary of the week’s work and sent
it to my sponsor\! Also fixed some GitHut hyperlinks.

**Saturday** - 1 hours 4 minutes - I didn’t have a .sav file to work
with, so I made one\! Writing it was more difficult than reading it
however; reading it wrote weird things to the file. 12 hours, 19 minutes
so far. If I spend another almost 3 hour day tomorrow this will be the
second week on-perfect track\!

**Sunday** - 1 hours 30 minutes - Contined work on chapter 4\! This time
I was practicing some basic data processing. Soon the chapter will lead
me to do mean, median, and mode with data.

End of week reflection.
