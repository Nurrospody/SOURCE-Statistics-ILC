**Monday** - 3 hours 2 minutes - Typed up end of week reflection for
week 4, finished up loop report, made new timecard. Worked with the
calculator function at the end of chapter 3\`. While reading the chapter
review, I discovered that it didnâ€™t *actually* teach me how to use loops
to print the same character-based message a hundred times . . . so I
figured out how to do it before closing out of chapter 3.
