**Monday** - 0 hours 55 minutes - Downloaded the rest of my R book because I could only download 200 pages total and my book was about 250 pages long.  Made new timecard and discussed schedule statagies.  My internet wasn't working for a while today so my workflow got interrupted.

**Tuesday** - 4 hours 10 minutes - Read ahead into the logical statements and loop functions . . . spent some time learning about how they worked from partner because they seemed a bit confusing.  Tried making some loops and logical functions.  
Also looked into time formatting for getting means of Smallmad[,6], found something called chron but it wasn't information helpful for what I was doing.  Learned about modulus %% and how it returns the remainder of division.

**Wednesday** - 2 hours 7 minutes - My reports have inconsistant formatting and are difficult to read, so I decided to spend some time today improving them.  They're now split up into smaller chunks.  I also completed the Vocabulary list for CH3.

**Thursday** - 0 hours 0 minutes

**Friday** - 0 hours 0 minutes

**Saturday** - 0 hours 0 minutes

**Sunday** - 0 hours 0 minutes
