*Reminder: Sunday work from Week 3 exists and was not discussed last ZOOM meeting.  Consider starting each week on Saturday?*

**Monday** - 0 hours 55 minutes - Downloaded the rest of my R book because I could only download 200 pages total and my book was about 250 pages long.  Made new timecard and discussed schedule statagies.  My internet wasn't working for a while today so my workflow got interrupted.

**Tuesday** - 4 hours 10 minutes - Read ahead into the logical statements and loop functions section. . . spent some time learning about how they worked from partner because they seemed a bit confusing, then tried making some loops and logical functions.  They're in their own report, "Logical Statements and Loops CH3"
Also looked into time formatting for getting means of Smallmad[,6], found something called chron but it wasn't information helpful for what I was doing.  Learned about modulus %% and how it returns the remainder of division.

**Wednesday** - 2 hours 7 minutes - My reports have inconsistant formatting and are difficult to read, so I decided to spend some time today improving them.  They're now split up into smaller chunks.  I also completed the Vocabulary list for CH3.

**Thursday** - 3 hours 10 minutes - Spent time making the Matrix and Madoka Data.frame report more legible; this (and the vector section) were the hardest to read. I found that rewording the reports was helpful because it engaged me with the material again (like a review?) and I recognized concepts better.  Also re-wrote the Logical Statements and Loops CH3 report, which was much easier after digesting the information for a day or two.  Updated the FULL Ch3 report, but decided I will not make both segmented reports and full reports for future chapters--it's so long that the scroll bar disappears in the R Code Editor, which is not good. 

**Friday** - 0 hours 0 minutes

**Saturday** - 0 hours 0 minutes

**Sunday** - 0 hours 0 minutes
