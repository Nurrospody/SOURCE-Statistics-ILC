Week 11 Worklog
================

6/25/2020

**Total Time from 21JUN2020 to 28JUN2020** : 1 hour 3 minutes

**Sunday, Monday, & Tuesday** - The plumbing in my apartment wasn’t
working, so everything was flooding and we basically didn’t have running
water. Other less notable stuff happened too. Because of all the chaos,
nothing productive really got done.

**Wednesday** - 45 minutes - Started reading chapter 6. It introduced
types of sampling (strat vs. cluster) and how to use sample() to pull
random samples from a variable. Also apply() loops, but it did a kind of
bad job at explaining what was going on. I was able to explain to my
roomate what was happening, but diving back in kind of gave me a
headache.

**Thursday** - 16 minutes - Decided to use “iris” sample to test some
Chapter 6 functions. Also made my timecard.  
I have to decide what I want to measure in my garden to use as my
practicum for collecting data. It really is just practicum in data
collection, so I’m not concerned about it being ‘groundbreaking stuff’
or anything. I just know having the skill and discipline is important.
Whatever I choose can’t risk damaging the very plants I’m collecting
from, so it can’t be too invasive. I’m thinking counting the blooms per
pansy plant per day could be one thing; and maybe measuring the compound
leaves on the cardoon plants could be another (since I have to decide
which one to keep). I probably shouldn’t use the pea plants or garlic,
because they’ve behaved very eratically and wouldn’t make good practice.
If any plants start fruiting in the future, I could count fruit
production, too.

**Friday** -

**Saturday** -

**End of Week Comments**: ugh okay so between  
1\. having my roomate’s now homeless partner come and go  
2\. our water system not working properly  
3\. my mom going into surgery  
4\. my room being unavailable all weekend because my partner was helping
his mom with legal stuff from morning to evening on both Sautrday and
Sunday

I basically just gave up trying to do any productive work this week. I
still have to format the work that I did in a report so I’ll be starting
that on Monday.
