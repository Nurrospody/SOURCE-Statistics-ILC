Week 13 Worklog
================
Nurrospody
7/8/2020

**Total Time inclusive from 6JUL2020 to 12JUL2020** : 5 hour 20 minutes

**Monday** - 12 minutes - collected data. Our water wasn’t working
again, so we had people in and out with loud power tools all day. After
I collected data I was going to input everything and update my
timecards, but honestly I was so stressed out I took a 90 minute walk
instead. Officially dedcided to start measuring the new leaves.

**Tuesday** - 11 minutes - collected data. Water stuff still out of
order. Thought about how I’ll need to compile a list of my ‘questions to
look into for using my data’.

**Wednesday** - 1 hour 21 minutes - collected data; updated timecards;
input 6 days’ data into excel sheets. (It’s supposed to be put in
daily.) Scanned in the papers that I’ve been recording data on in the
garden, so that I have them to show off. ADD PDF SCAN OF DATA COLLECTION
TO README.

**Thursday** - 30 minutes? - collected data, looked over some old
material for review, but forgot to stop my timer so had to restart it.

**Friday** - 44 minutes - collected data; input values into excel sheet.

**Saturday** - 11 minutes - collected data.

**Sunday** - 2 hours 23 minutes - collected data; input values ito excel
sheet; wrote self-eval and list of activities did in Spring ILC.

**End of Week Comments**: Because everything was so out of control I was
sleeping for 10+ hours each night so waking up late, but I mid-week
decided to fix that so that I have enough time to be productive. I kind
of succeeded? I was better at inputting my data into excel every day
rather than in a giant lump. I wanted to start R and textbook stuff but
then I remembered that I HAD to make the list of activities I did in
Spring 2020.
