**Start of Week Comments**: This is week 9 but it should be more like .
. . week 4 . . . given the amount of successful weeks I’ve had this
summer. I really don’t know why it’s been so hard since basically week 7
of my spring semester. By impulse I want to say that I wish I’d taken
the summer off but . . . I’ve been able to do some really good things
because of the stuff I learned around week 4 and 5 of this quarter.
Interacting with the people in my server with my stats knowledge was
really amazing. I’ve had a new dataset from someone who worked hard to
compile it for like a week and I have to do stuff with it . . . I’ve
been too depressed to touch it but I really ought to use it once I can.
For now I need to do non-parametrics to finish my book, and look into my
basic stats book from Stats 1-2 to refresh on when to use them. I can
look into resampling some other time.
