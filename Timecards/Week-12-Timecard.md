**Total Time from 29JUN2020 to XJUL2020** :

**Monday** - 1 hours 3 minutes - Made new worklog; wrote up end comments
for Week 11 worklog. Decided to record data of: \# of flowers on pansy
plants 1-5 AND length of leaves on Cardoon plants 1-2. Going out into
the garden to record the data for the first time was pretty fun; I had
to think about how to record the data. At first I started making an
Rmarkdown document, but I realized that I wouldn’t be able to easily use
the data if I recorded it that way. Instead, I chose to make an excel
workbook. The workbook has 4 sheets, one for each type of data (live
pansy, dead pansy, cardoon 1, cardoon 2), and each sheet has 6 columns:
date, then plant or leaf 1-5. For the cardoons I’m not actually keeping
track of WHICH leaf is how long since it doesn’t matter, but they still
needed to all be in their own column. I’ll need to use Header=TRUE and
specify the sheet number when I do something with my data practicum.
