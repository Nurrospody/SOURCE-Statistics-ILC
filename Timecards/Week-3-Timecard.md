**Monday** Aprx. 1 hours 32 minutes - Updated README for Report
Repository, pushed and commited work from week 2 to github. Continued
work on Chapter 3.  
**Tuesday** Aprx. 2 hours 0 minutes - Continued work on Chapter 3.
Realized it’s a 40+ page chapter and there’s still 20 pages left. Plan
to delve into getting a .csv into R tomorrow.  
**Wednesday** Aprx. 1 hours 50 minutes - Figured out how to load a .csv
file into R\! Had to mess around with file paths. Fixed my image that
wasn’t working in Chapter 2 Report. Used cmd line.  
**Thursday** Aprx. 4 hours 30 minutes - Experimented more with my .csv,
referred to the cran.r project for help a bit, reorganized my
repositories into one repository with better directories, better README,
and fixed file paths that changed; more progress on report.  
**Friday** Aprx. 0 hours 30 minutes - ZOOM call with faculty, showed off
progress so far. Should maybe do a histogram with the timestamp data and
see about converting it if neccesary, work with mean/median/mode, then
move to a different dataset. Spend most of the day working on other
class, though.  
**Saturday** - N/A  
**Sunday** Aprx. 1 hours 48 minutes - For a change of pace, I read the
Intro and Chapter 1 of my other required textbook: *Statistics Done
Wrong* by Alex Reinhart and wrote about my engagement with the text\!

I feel pretty good about this week. I got to experiment with dataframes
and my .csv file; lots of hands on learning. I’m pretty close to the end
of chapter 3 but I stopped being concerned about ‘finishing the chapter’
so much as making sure I made progress each day–I used some external
tools, made good use of help() in RConsole, made my GitHub look so much
better; even took some time to read my other book I’ve been wanting to
read during the weekend. It’s strange to think that it’ll already be
Week 4, though.
