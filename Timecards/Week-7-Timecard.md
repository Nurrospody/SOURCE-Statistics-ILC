**Monday** - 2 hours 38 minutes - set up timecard and README hyperlink,
wrote Week 6 reflection. Wrote up the section on skewness and kurtosis,
complete with their definitions; although I had learned about it last
week, I didn’t actually get to using the equations. I had an issue where
CRAN wasn’t mirroring correctly, so I had to manually reset the
repository in my knit for the first time. I also looked up how to make a
better ‘distribution curve’ graph for my kurtosis example that wasn’t a
historgram or a Q-Q plot that would simply prove normality, so I learned
how to plot a Kernel Density plot.  
Settup chapter 4 part5 report. Only binomial and str() summary() are
left, so this should be the last part of chapter 4.

**Tuesday** - 2 hours 9 minutes - Learned how to work with binomial
distributions in R, used both the book and R’s help() function to figure
out what everything did. Discovered that R doesn’t have a count
function? I could have sworn it did and that I used it, but I couldn’t
find it in any of my reports so I’ll look into it later (I wanted to
count how many heads and how many tails my simulated data got). Made
some quick summaries/structures to wrap up the chapter. Fixed a () error
in README.

*Note: Kurtosis represents how common extreme values (data on the tails)
are. Investigate why a symmetrically skewed, high kurtosis curve, IS or
IS NOT normal.*
