Week 7 Timecard
================
Nurrospody
5/11/2020

**Monday** - 2 hours 38 minutes - set up timecard and README hyperlink,
wrote Week 6 reflection. [In Chapter 4
part 4](https://github.com/Nurrospody/SOURCE-Statistics-ILC/blob/master/Chapter%20Reports/CH4-part4.md),
I: Wrote up the section on skewness and kurtosis, complete with their
definitions; although I had learned about it last week, I didn’t
actually get to using the equations. I had an issue where CRAN wasn’t
mirroring correctly, so I had to manually reset the repository in my
knit for the first time. I also looked up how to make a better
‘distribution curve’ graph for my kurtosis example that wasn’t a
historgram or a Q-Q plot that would simply prove normality, so I learned
how to plot a Kernel Density plot.  
Settup chapter 4 part5 report. Only binomial and str() summary() are
left, so this should be the last part of chapter 4.

**Tuesday** - 2 hours 10 minutes - [In Chapter 4
Part 5](https://github.com/Nurrospody/SOURCE-Statistics-ILC/blob/master/Chapter%20Reports/CH4-part5.md),
I: Learned how to work with binomial distributions in R, used both the
book and R’s help() function to figure out what everything did.
Discovered that R doesn’t have a count function? I could have sworn it
did and that I used it, but I couldn’t find it in any of my reports so
I’ll look into it later (I wanted to count how many heads and how many
tails my simulated data got). Made some quick summaries/structures to
officially finish chapter 4. Fixed a () error in README.

**Wednesday** - 2 hours 33 minutes - I read through the whole of chapter
5 so that I knew what to expect when doing the excercises in R; because
ggplot2 graphics look so much better than the default R graphs–and are
more professional/relevant–I should probably practice making both the
regular AND gg at the same time. E.g. when I practice making line graphs
or scatterplots, I should make both the regular AND gg before moving on,
rather than leaving gg til the end like the book does. It looks like
figuring out the gg coding will be complicated, so pacing it between
more normal graphs should help.  
Then my computer . . . froze up and wouldn’t turn off with the power
button, so I had to wait for it to die on its own. So instead of making
a bunch of graphs, I read chapter 2 of my Statistics Done Wrong book. I
told my partner he should read the chapters so he can be as cynical and
disappointed as me now.

**Thursday** - 2 hours 43 minutes - Wrote up the [Statistics Gone Wrong
musings from
chapter 2](https://github.com/Nurrospody/SOURCE-Statistics-ILC/blob/master/Statistics%20Done%20Wrong%20Musings/CH2.md),
now that my computer is back in buisness. Created new report skeleton
and added to README –“why is it doing that?” (today I learned if you
don’t have — under your header it doesn’t get detected properly when
knitting\!). I then started a [report on my high kurtosis/normal data
question](https://github.com/Nurrospody/SOURCE-Statistics-ILC/blob/master/Chapter%20Reports/SPECIALCH4.md),
which was mostly reading a lot to figure out the different normality
tests.

**Friday** - 0 hours 20 minutes - Worked more on SPECIAL normality of
data report; organized what I had written a little bit better. But then
my I had an internet outage that lasted until dinnertime . . . so I
couldn’t download any of the packs I needed for most normality tests or
do much.

**Saturday** - 0 hours 0 minutes - Took a break today.

**Sunday** - 0 hours 0 minutes - Worked on the living room today:
finally got a truck to move our unwanted furniture out, so we could
build our wanted furniture and re-arrange things\!

*Note: Kurtosis represents how common extreme values (data on the tails)
are. Investigate why a symmetrically skewed, high kurtosis curve, IS or
IS NOT normal.*

Until my work got interrupted by internet outages and it being the
weekend so time to work on other things . . . I think I did pretty well.
I finished chapter 4 and then started chapter 5. I didn’t worry about
time very much and instead concentrated on just getting enough work
done. This week was a LOT of reading, and some of the info was pretty
dense–I spent hours just reading through what different statistics tests
are, and what different test statistics are. (That sentence looks funny,
but statistics tests and test statistics ARE different things). Because
it was so much reading the quantity of words in my report doesn’t really
show everything I did this week–an hour of reading may end up as one or
two concise explanation sentences afterall, or may effect the graphs I
make in the future.  
On Wednesday, my workload got interrupted because of my computer
freezing up. So I had to switch to reading my stats book instead of
practicing graphs. And I really wish that my graph momentum hadn’t
gotten interrupted . . . because when I started working the next day, it
was like, “uuugggh I gotta make graphs ALL DAY NOW” *and* I was just
starting for the first time . . . so I did something else i.e. writing
the report from my Musings reading, and working on the special
kurtosis/normality question. I think if I could have started a little
bit on Wednesday, if my computer hadn’t froze up, I would have been much
more okay continuing on Thursday. Oh well.  
I took a look again at my contract description for Advanced Statistics.
It’s interesting because I’ve been doing everything except for actually
working through problem sets. Learning all of the basics of R and
programing has taken and is taking a very long time. And while it would
be to my advantage to eventually work through some problems with
intended solution methods and etc . . . I feel like I’ve been doing a
pretty good job with what I have been learning, and I’m sure I’ll get
there *eventually*. Something I’m thinking about is that even through
the contract only lasts 10 weeks, it’s not like I’m going to stop
learning R after the 10 weeks ends. I’ll just . . . keep going,
regardless of if I have a sponsor or a credit backing me up or not. The
slowness of learning R has taught me that regardness of me spending my
last quarters learning about stats or not, I won’t be ready to throw
myself into the job market by the time I graduate. I’ll have to keep
learning anyway. Whether it’s learning R; learning more about different
stats calculations I don’t know; trying to work on retention so I don’t
have to refer to old reports every time I want to do something; learning
calculus like my sponsor reccomended since my mathematics skeleton is
lacking some vertebra . . . I’ll just keep working on it. It’s really
nice to have a direction, and it’s helpful that in th is time of
COVID-19 everything is on-pause anyway. This is one of the best times to
learn and come back better.
