**Monday** - 3 hours 2 minutes - Typed up end of week reflection for week 4, finished up loop report, made new timecard.  Worked with the calculator function at the end of chapter 3`.  While reading the chapter review, I discovered that it didn't *actually* teach me how to use loops to print the same character-based message a hundred times . . . so I figured out how to do it before closing out of chapter 3.

**Tuesday** - 3 hours 2 minutes +10 FOR MISSED TIMER - Begun reading chapter 4 (descriptive statistics) and working on chapter 4 report!  Had to go onto an Rtools instalation adventure to use the xlsl package.

**Wednesday** - 0 hours 0 minutes - work description
