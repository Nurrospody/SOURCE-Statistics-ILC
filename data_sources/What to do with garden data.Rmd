**Things to do once garden data is finished being collected, on 28Jul2020 at minimum**  
-Deal with missing values (some cardoon leaves had died, or grown new)  
-Get the average change (growth) of each indivual cardoon leaf, and each individual plant, per day  
-Get the average pansy flower growth of each individual flower per day  
-Is there any way to use ANOVA with this data as-is?  Or must commplementary n30 data be gathered until the 26th of August?  
-Visualze data in graphs that make sense (certain graphs wouldn't make sense)  

*Add more as you think of what to do, this list should grow overtime*
