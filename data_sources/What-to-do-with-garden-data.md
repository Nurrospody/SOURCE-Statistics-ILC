**Things to do once garden data is finished being collected, on
28Jul2020 at minimum**  
\-Deal with missing values (some cardoon leaves had died, or grown
new)  
\-Get the average change (growth) of each indivual cardoon leaf, and
each individual plant, per day  
\-Get the average pansy flower growth of each individual flower per
day  
\-Is there any way to use ANOVA with this data as-is? Or must
commplementary n30 data be gathered until the 26th of August?  
\-Visualze data in graphs that make sense (certain graphs wouldn’t make
sense)

*Add more as you think of what to do, this list should grow overtime*
